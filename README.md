## How to get started

 1. Clone this repo
 2. Run tests with `npm test`
 3. Honestly there's not anything else to do yet

The tests use [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
and [expect.js](https://github.com/Automattic/expect.js).

## Docs for the dependencies

 1. OpenMath - [see here](https://lurchmath.github.io/openmath-js/site/)
 2. Structure - [see here](https://github.com/lurchmath/lde/blob/master/src/structure.litcoffee)
