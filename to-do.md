# List of to-dos

 1. All the remaining stuff Ken has planned out in his Notability file
 2. Incorporate a real test suite to prevent regression
 3. Start using Structure attributes and copying correctly, now that we've
    fixed the bug in the Structure class, by removing the custom `copy()`
    methods in the LC/Statement/Environment classes, because they're no longer
    needed
